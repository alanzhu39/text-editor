In progress:
- vertical mode arrow movement
- cleaning up, make sure horizontal mode still works
- activate via command line arg

Finished:
Vertical mode
- mostly just have to update editor view?
  - can we have it as a toggle. yes I think so, just refactor drawing functions and choose based on mode flag
- draw lines
- draw margin
- updated tab and esc keyboard input behavior
- draw cursor
- cursor highlighting
- cursor might be hard to do? feel like it might be easier if we rotate the viewing window, and then cursor functionality would be unchanged
  - should have thought this through more at the beginning lol
